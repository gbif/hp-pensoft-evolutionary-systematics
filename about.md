This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Evolutionary Systematics](https://evolsyst.pensoft.net/).

**Evolutionary Systematics** (formerly Mitteilungen aus dem Hamburgischen Zoologischen Museum und Institut) edited by the Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change is an international, peer-reviewed, life science journal, devoted to whole-organism biology. It mainly publishes original research and review articles in the field of metazoan taxonomy, biosystematics, evolution, morphology, development and biogeography at all taxonomic levels, ​as well as articles on the history of science, in particular on museum-based or specimen-related aspects. Its scope encompasses primary information from collection-related research, for example taxonomic descriptions and discoveries, revisions, annotated type catalogues, aspects of the history of science, and contributions on new methods and principles of systematics. Articles whose main topic is ecology, functional anatomy, physiology, or ethology are only acceptable when of clear systematic or evolutionary relevance and perspective. Review articles and contributions to a discussion forum are welcome, but authors are asked to contact the editors beforehand.
